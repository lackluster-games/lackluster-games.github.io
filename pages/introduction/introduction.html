          </header>
          <p>
              This is my journey to learn <a id="love2d_link" target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://love2d.org/">Love2d</a> by making a very simplistic and basic platformer style game.<br>
              I'll document and talk about the parts of the game and my design decisions along the way.<br>
            This will mostly be for my benefit, but i hope that others can learn or gain something from it as well.

              <h2>Why this stuff in particular?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Why did i choose to use lua and love2d for game dev?</p>
          <h3>Why <a id="Lus_link" target="_blank" rel="external" hre="https://www.lua.org/">lua?</a></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I am fairly familiar with lua at this point.</li>
            <li>I generally like working with lua. Liking the language is important when working on a decent sized project</li>
            <li>I find the syntax of lua fairly easy to read. in general i like the syntax of lua.</li>
            <li>There is a pretty well developed game dev ecosystem for the language.
                <ul>
                    <li>Love2d is made for using lua. Since it is the framework i am using, it makes sense to use the language for it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Why Love2d?</h3>
          <p>so why did i choose Love2d when there are other options?</p>
          <ul>
              <li>I already have a tiny bit of knowledge and experience with Love2d.
                  <ul>
                      <li>Not much knowledge and experience though. Just what could be considered a hello world program for it.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>It is a simple and easy to use framework.
                  <ul>
                      <li>Does what i need it to, and not much more.</li>
                      <li>It seems pretty straightforward. Nothing that even i couldn't understand.</li>
                  </ul> 
              </li>
              <li>Simple 2d games seem to be what it is intended for, and since that is what i'm making it seems the best tool to use.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Why a platformer</h3>
          <p>So why did i choose to make a platformer rather than a different genre of game.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It needed to be a 2d game</li>
            <li>It needs to be more than a simple game that can be made in 200 lines of code or fewer.
                <ul>
                    <li>If it is too simple of a game, I wont learn much or have much fun making it.</li>
                    <li>If it is too complicated, I will get burned out and not have fun making it.</li>
                </ul>  
            </li>
            <li>The object isn't to make the funnest or most mind blowing game ever.
                <ul>
                    <li>It needs to be something which I can handle. I'm no expert game dev nor expert programmer</li>
                    <li>It primarily serves as a learning opportunity for me.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So with all those criteria for the game, i decided that a platformer is the one which best fits my needs.It will not be the most advanced game ever made.<br>
            Nor will it be particular fun game to play, nor any revolutionary or breakthrough mechanics. <br>
            I cant even claim it will be programmed well or efficiently.<br>
            But i can say that it will definitely teach me a thing or two about game dev, programming, and using love2d.
